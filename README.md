# Horiseon-updated

## Description 

For this project, I was given source code for a Horiseon project which was nearly complete with given HTML and CSS files. In this project, the given source code was not optimized for accessability standards. I refactored a lot of the code by adding semantic html elements, provided alternative text to the images and more. I also learned how to quickly review other people's code rather than writing my own which is a skill I want to practice.
